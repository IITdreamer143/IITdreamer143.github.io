<p>Pandavkada is quite adventurous place to visit. Waterfall is big and one can have fun with friends. Here, one can do trekking and one should never go there without shoes. This is place little bit dangerous so one should be cautious while going to Pandavkada. I enjoyed alot with my friends and I also did some trekking here. </p>

<p>NNP is pretty good place to visit with friends. You can have little bit of trekking. You can have some peaceful time. I enjoyed alot with friends and took bath in waterfall. Please be very cautious there as it on the mountain and near Arrey forest so there is some chances of wild animals coming near waterfall.</p>
